# Countdown Timer

This is a Countdown Timer created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

You can use it right into your browser.

Here I have used JavaScript and HTML DOM to make the timer interactive .I have used CSS to style the website.

This Timer also provides a feature to change the day and date of the event.
